# CC: Tweaked Documentation
This documentation covers the Lua API for [ComputerCraft: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/) and is meant to be used with [Sumneko's Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) as it uses its LuaCATS annotation system.

## Setup

### VS Code
This project has been included in [LLS-Addons](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons) and is available in the addon manager in VS Code! You can also still follow the steps below if you prefer.

### Other Clients
1. Download this repository
2. Set up [a folder for containing environment emulations](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Libraries#setup)
3. In this folder, create a new folder named `CC-Tweaked` or something similar.
4. Paste the contents from this repo in this new `CC-Tweaked` folder.
5. Edit your [configuration file](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File) and add the path to the folder containing your new `CC-Tweaked` folder to [`workspace.userThirdParty`](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#workspaceuserthirdparty).

Now when you trigger one of the below cases you should be prompted to set up your workspace as a `CC: Tweaked` environment.

Trigger cases:
- Following phrases are found in file (chosen for their uniqueness):
  - `turtle.???`
  - `rednet.???`
  - `redstone.???`
  - `minecraft`
  - `computercraft`

After applying the workspace, you should have full autocompletion and diagnostics.

> **Note**
>
> CC: Tweaked has some [seriously cursed](https://tweaked.cc/reference/feature_compat.html) support for Lua features, thus, the environment is a *little* messy and is not currently emulated as accurately as possible. As time goes on, it may be possible to improve this ðŸ™‚.
